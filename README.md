# octane.gg API Download

This is a python script that will download the API of octane.gg. It hits the top level API without any option parameters set, downloading each page if there are multiple.
This means that if you want, say, the data from GarrettG during a specific event, you won't get the convenient API that octane.gg created that lets you search for things.
Instead, if you have to find the event he played in, get the matches in the event, then go to the `matches` folder and find the games, where you can then see his stats or other data.
